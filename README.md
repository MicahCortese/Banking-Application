# Banking-Application

*****************
   DESCRIPTION
*****************

A simple banking application built with Java in the Eclipse IDE that allows the user to check their current balance (starting at $0), deposit and withdraw funds, and exit the program. 
I built this as a way to learn simple GUIs as well as adding button functionality to GUIs
